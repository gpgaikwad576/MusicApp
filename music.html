      <header>Sholay Song</header>
      <p>In the small village of Ramgarh, former police inspector Thakur Baldev Singh summons a pair of small-time
        thieves that he had once arrested. Thakur feels that the duo – Veeru and Jai – would be ideal to help him
        capture Gabbar Singh, a dacoit wanted by the authorities for a ₹50,000[b] reward. Thakur tells them to surrender
        Gabbar to him alive for an additional ₹20,000 reward.</p>

        <p>
          The two thieves thwart the dacoits sent by Gabbar to extort the villagers. Soon afterwards, Gabbar and his goons
        attack Ramgarh during the festival of Holi. In a tough battle, Veeru and Jai are cornered. Though Thakur has a
        gun within his reach, he does not help them. Veeru and Jai fight back and the bandits flee. However, Veeru and
        Jai are upset at Thakur's inaction and consider calling off the deal by leaving the village. Thakur explains
        that Gabbar had killed nearly all of his family members and had both his arms cut off a few years earlier, and
        that he concealed the dismemberment by always wearing a shawl, which is the sole reason why he could not use the
        gun in the first place.

        </p>
        <p>
        Realizing how much Thakur has suffered so much at the hands of Gabbar and his thugs, Veeru and Jai have a change
        of a heart by declining the reward money and swearing an oath that they will capture Gabbar alive. While
        protecting Ramgarh, the jovial Veeru and cynical Jai find themselves growing fond of the villagers. Veeru is
        attracted to Basanti, a feisty, talkative young woman who makes her living by driving a horse-cart. Jai is drawn
        to Thakur's widowed daughter-in-law Radha, who subtly returns his affections.</p>
          <p>
        However, the skirmishes between Gabbar's gang and the duo intensify when Gabbar murders the local inam's son to
        coerce the villagers into surrendering Veeru and Jai. When the villagers refused and instead got the duo to kill
        four of Gabbar's men in revenge for the boy's death, Gabbar angrily retaliates by having his men capture Veeru
        and Basanti, forcing the latter to dance non-stop or he will have Veeru killed.

        Jai arrives to the rescue by attacking the gang, and the three are able to flee Gabbar's hideout with dacoits in
        pursuit. Fighting from behind a rock, Jai and Veeru nearly run out of ammunition. Veeru, unaware that Jai was
        wounded in the gunfight, is forced to leave for more ammunition and also to drop Basanti at a safe place. Jai
        eventually sacrifices himself by using his last bullet to ignite dynamite sticks on a bridge from close range,
        killing several of Gabbar's men.</p>

      <header>Tarhana</header>
      <p>sung by Muhmmad Rafi</p>
      <p>Rafi moved to Bombay (now Mumbai), Maharashtra in 1944. He and Hameed Sahab rented a ten-by-ten-feet room in
        the crowded downtown Bhendi Bazar area. Poet Tanvir Naqvi introduced him to film producers including Abdur
        Rashid Kardar, Mehboob Khan and actor-director Nazeer.[15] Shyam Sunder was in Bombay and provided the
        opportunity to Rafi to sing a duet with G. M. Durrani, "Aji dil ho kaabu mein to dildar ki aisi taisi...," for
        Gaon Ki Gori, which became Rafi's first recorded song in a Hindi film. Other songs followed.
        </p>
        <p>
        Rafi's first song with Naushad was "Hindustan Ke Hum Hain" with Shyam Kumar, Alauddin and others, from A. R.
        Kardar's Pehle Aap (1944). Around the same time, Rafi recorded another song for the 1945 film Gaon Ki Gori, "Aji
        Dil Ho Kaaboo Mein". He considered this song to be his first Hindi language song.[14]
      </p>
      <p>
        Rafi appeared in two movies. He appeared on the screen for the songs "Tera Jalwa Jis Ne Dekha" in film Laila
        Majnu(1945) and "Woh Apni Yaad Dilane Ko" in the Film Jugnu (1947).[14] He sang a number of songs for Naushad as
        part of the chorus, including "Mere Sapnon Ki Rani, Roohi Roohi" with K. L. Saigal, from the film Shahjahan
        (1946). Rafi sang "Tera Khilona Toota Balak" from Mehboob Khan's Anmol Ghadi (1946) and a duet with Noor Jehan
        in the 1947 film Jugnu, "Yahan Badla Wafa Ka". After partition, Rafi decided to stay back in India and had the
        rest of his family flown to Bombay. Noor Jehan migrated to Pakistan and made a pair with playback singer Ahmed
        Rushdi.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1949, Rafi was given solo songs by music directors such as Naushad (Chandni Raat, Dillagi and Dulari), Shyam
        Sunder (Bazaar) and Husnalal Bhagatram (Meena Bazaar).

        Besides K. L. Saigal, whom he considered his favorite, Rafi was also influenced by G. M. Durrani. In the early
        phase of his career, he often followed Durrani's style of singing, but later evolved his own, unique style. He
        sang with Durrani in some of the songs such as "Humko Hanste Dekh Zamana Jalta Hai" and "Khabar Kisi Ko Nahiin,
        Woh Kidhar Dekhte" (Beqasoor, 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1948, after the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, the team of Husanlal Bhagatram-Rajendra Krishan-Rafi had
        overnight created the song "Suno Suno Ae Duniyawalon, Bapuji Ki Amar Kahani". He was invited by the Indian Prime
        Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, to sing at his house. In 1948, Rafi received a silver medal from Jawaharlal Nehru on
        Indian Independence Day.[16]</p>
